# Hey, I'm Hunter 👋

I'm an AI Engineer, founder, and athlete based in South Brazil. I build tools that actually help people — especially freelancers, corporate businesses, and professionals looking to work smarter.

## 🌊 What I'm Working On

- **[ProHora](https://www.prohora.app/)** — a productivity app for professionals.  
- AI consulting, including a **smart RAG system** for finance analytics with a larger company.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- **Claude Code** — power user  
- **LangChain & LangGraph** for agent orchestration  
- Flexible stack — whatever gets the job done  
- Mate = daily fuel  

## 🎯 Goals This Year

- Help professionals work more efficiently and stress-free  
- Keep improving my products with real user feedback  
- Stay strong, train consistently, and read more  
- Build systems I actually enjoy running  

## 🐾 Other Stuff

- Train almost every day — CrossFit, gymnastics rings, surfing when possible  
- Big dog named **Bife** — we bike together every morning  
- Believe in good systems, clear design, and building things that feel right
