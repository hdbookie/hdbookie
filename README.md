# Hey, I'm Hunter 👋

I'm a builder, founder, and athlete living in South Brazil. I love making tools that actually help people — especially surf teachers, freelancers, and small business owners.

### 🌊 What I'm working on

Right now I’m focused on SurfHunter— a simple app that helps surf instructors manage their students, schedule lessons, and grow their business. It's already the fastest-growing surf app in Brazil.

### 🛠️ Tools I use

- **Flutter** for building fast cross-platform apps  
- **Firebase** for auth, database, and cloud functions  
- **Node/TypeScript** when needed  
- Some Domain-Driven Design to keep things clean  
- And yeah — air fryer + coffee = daily fuel

### 🎯 Goals this year

- Help 1,0000 surf teachers make more money with less stress  
- Keep improving the product and getting real feedback  
- Stay strong, train consistently, and read more  
- Build a system I actually enjoy running

### 🐾 Other stuff

- I train almost every day — CrossFit, gymnastics rings, surfing when I can  
- I’ve got a big dog named **Bife** — we bike together every morning  
- I believe in good systems, clear design, and building things that feel right
